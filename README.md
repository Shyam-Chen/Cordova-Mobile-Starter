# Micro Fullstack

:maple_leaf: ECMAScript Microservices Development: Build, test, deploy, and scale microservices in ECMAScript.

Here's how to make Microservices quick and easy:

- Create microservice applications using JavaScript and TypeScript
- Register multiple single-page applications on a single page with Single SPA
- Craft reusable components with the Web Components specifications
- Build applications with the best front-end frameworks, such as Vue, React, Angular and Svelte
- Design a service gateway and service registry with Kong Gateway
- Write, load and run portable binary code with AssemblyScript and WebAssembly
- Build applications with the best back-end frameworks, such as Koa, Express, Nest and Fastify
- Containerize microservice-based applications with Docker
- Deploy, serve, and scale applications with the Knative Serving module
